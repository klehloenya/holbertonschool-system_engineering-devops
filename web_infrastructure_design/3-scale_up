The task is essentially asking about creating a distributed system architecture that separates different components onto their own servers. 

Required Components:

Additional Server
HAproxy Load Balancer (in cluster configuration)
Separated components on different servers:

Web Server (e.g., Nginx/Apache)
Application Server
Database Server




Let's clarify Web Server vs Application Server:

Web Server: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content (HTML, CSS, images)
Application Server: Runs the application logic, processes dynamic content, executes business logic


Why Add Each Component:

a) Additional Server:

Provides redundancy
Increases system reliability
Allows for better resource distribution
Enables handling more concurrent users

b) HAproxy Load Balancer in Cluster:

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
Provides high availability
Prevents server overload
Cluster configuration ensures load balancer redundancy
Enables seamless failover if one load balancer fails

c) Component Separation:
Web Server on Dedicated Server:

Optimized for serving static content
Better resource allocation
Can be scaled independently
Improved security through isolation

Application Server on Dedicated Server:

Focused resources for business logic
Independent scaling based on application needs
Better resource utilization
Easier maintenance and updates

Database Server on Dedicated Server:

Optimized for database operations
Better data security
Independent scaling of database resources
Improved performance for data-intensive operations


Benefits of This Architecture:


Better resource utilization
Improved security through component isolation
Easy to scale individual components
Better fault isolation
Improved maintenance capabilities
Enhanced performance through specialized optimization

This architecture represents a significant step up from a monolithic setup, allowing for better scalability, reliability, and maintenance while providing a more robust infrastructure for handling increased load and traffic.
