## Component Explanations

### Server
- A physical or virtual machine that hosts all components
- Provides computing resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) to run the web services
- IP Address: 8.8.8.8

### Domain Name (foobar.com)
- Purpose: Provides a human-readable address to access the website
- DNS Record: 'www' is a CNAME record pointing to foobar.com
- DNS A Record maps foobar.com to IP 8.8.8.8

### Web Server (Nginx)
- Handles incoming HTTP requests
- Serves static content
- Manages SSL/TLS encryption
- Routes requests to application server
- Load balancing (if configured)

### Application Server
- Executes the application's business logic
- Processes dynamic content
- Handles application state
- Communicates with database
- Runs the actual codebase

### Database (MySQL)
- Stores persistent data
- Manages data relationships
- Handles data queries
- Ensures data integrity
- Manages user data, content, etc.

### Client-Server Communication
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol
- TCP/IP for network communication
- Request-Response cycle
- Stateless communication

## Infrastructure Issues

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
1. Single Server: If it fails, entire site goes down
2. Single Database: No backup if database crashes
3. Single Web Server: No redundancy for web service
4. Single Application Server: No failover capability

### Maintenance Downtime
1. Code deployments require server restart
2. Database updates need system downtime
3. Server patches/updates require reboot
4. No redundancy during maintenance

### Scalability Limitations
1. Single server can't handle high traffic loads
2. No load balancing capability
3. Limited resource scaling options
4. Database performance bottlenecks
5. No distributed processing capability

## Security Concerns (Additional)
1. No firewall mentioned
2. No HTTPS encryption specified
3. Single point for security breaches
4. No separation of concerns for security

## Recommendations
1. Add redundant servers
2. Implement load balancing
3. Set up database replication
4. Add firewall and security measures
5. Implement CDN for static content
6. Set up monitoring systems
7. Add backup systems
